# SupraChat - Frontend

A static site built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs), [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/),
[@tanstack/react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest), [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand),
[react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/), [zod](https://zod.dev/) and (obviously) TypeScript!

## THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS!

Some cleanup is still needed and some functionalities are incomplete, this is non-exhaustive
ToDo list:

- Remove `styled-components` in favor of `DaisyUI` and `tailwindcss`
- Style forms correctly
- Complete user profile functionality
- Recreate radio player component from scratch
